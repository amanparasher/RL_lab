# Reinforcement Learning Experiments

This repository contains implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms. The experiments conducted include:

## Q-Learning (Off Policy TD Learning)
- Q-Learning is an off-policy Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm used to learn the optimal action-value function.

## Monte Carlo Off-Policy Control with Importance Sampling
- This experiment implements Monte Carlo Off-Policy Control, which is a method to learn the optimal policy using Monte Carlo sampling with importance sampling.

## SARSA (On Policy TD Learning)
- SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) is an on-policy Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm used to learn the optimal policy.

## Monte Carlo Prediction
- Monte Carlo Prediction is a method to estimate the value function of a policy by averaging sample returns.
